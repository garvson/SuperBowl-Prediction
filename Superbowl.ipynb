    "# 1. TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n",
    "Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. It's a show. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:\n",
    "- What are the most extreme game outcomes?\n",
    "- How does the game affect television viewership?\n",
    "- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?\n",
    "- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?\n",
    "\n",
    "The database  use is named Superbowl. It was scraped and polished from Wikipedia and is made up of three tables, one with game data, one with TV broadcast data, and one with halftime musician performance data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018. "

We also have Super Bowl IX in New Orleans in 1975, whose 16-6 score can be attributed to inclement weather. The field was slick from overnight rain, and it was cold at 46 °F (8 °C), making it hard for the Steelers and Vikings to do much offensively. This was the second-coldest Super Bowl ever and the last to be played in inclement weather for over 30 years. The NFL realized people like points, I guess.\n",

    "The closest game ever was when the Buffalo Bills lost to the New York Giants by 1 point in 1991, which was best remembered for Scott Norwood's last-second missed field goal attempt that went wide right, kicking off four Bills Super Bowl losses in a row. Poor Scott. The biggest point discrepancy ever was 45 points (!) where Hall of Famer Joe Montana's led the San Francisco 49ers to victory in 1990, one year before the closest game ever.\n",

    "I remember watching the Seahawks crush the Broncos by 35 points (43-8) in 2014, which was a boring experience in my opinion. The game was never really close. I'm pretty sure we changed the channel at the end of the third quarter. Let's combine our game data and TV data to see if this is a universal phenomenon. Do large point differences translate to lost viewers? Let's compare household share (average percentage of U.S. households with a TV in use that were watching for the entire broadcast) for \"blowouts\" (games where the point difference is three touchdowns, i.e., 21 points, or more) vs. non-blowouts."

    "# 9. Halftime shows weren't always this great\n",

    "We can see viewers increased before ad costs did. avg_us_viewers was 90 million in 1998 (Super Bowl XXXII) and an ad cost 1.29 million dollars. That is an inflation adjusted 2.02 million dollars in 2018, where avg_us_viewers was actually 103 million and ad_cost was 5 million dollars. Maybe the networks weren't very data savvy and were slow to react. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another hypothesis: maybe halftime shows weren't that good in the earlier years? The modern spectacle of the Super Bowl has a lot to do with the cultural prestige of big halftime acts. I went down a YouTube rabbit hole and it turns out the old ones weren't up to today's standards. Some offenders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Super Bowl XXVI in 1992: A Frosty The Snowman rap performed by children.\n",
    "- Super Bowl XXIII in 1989: An Elvis impersonator that did magic tricks and didn't even sing one Elvis song.\n",
    "- Super Bowl XXI in 1987: Tap dancing ponies. \n",
    "                                               \n",
    "It turns out Michael Jackson's Super Bowl XXVII performance, one of the most watched events in American TV history, was when the NFL realized the value of Super Bowl airtime and decided they needed to sign big name acts from then on out. The halftime shows before MJ indeed weren't that impressive, which we can see by filtering our performances table."

It's important to note that the duration of the halftime show is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have.
